## olcourses

Update 1 

Ok, so far the course was great, finished it about 2-3 weeks earlier then expected. 
I still am not sure if i'll be going for the advanced track (I thinks that is what is called) with the University of Michigan.
The work with this course and the Data science tool box was relatively simple, yet they served well to get me familiarized again 
with basics of programming as well as learning Git and GitHub.
That was quite fun and, I believe, of great value in the future.

Update 2 

Finished the second course that covered some specifc python data structures like lists, dictionaries and tuples and in was quite usefull. 
Tuples are crazy do understand the direct use of them, but dictionaries (or hash tables , ha, so snobish of me) can be seen to have direct use.
Also, I already started the 3rd course of the UM and its nice to see the use of pythin to go through web data.

I thought about taking the Intro to CS by MITx that also coverd python programming, not to only make the conceps sink in but to learn proper cs concepts and vocabulary.
I did not go through with that idea. It seemed too much of a pain to re-learn, a couple weeks later, the same concepts.
Instead, I'll see if I can follow the Stanford Algorithim course on Coursera, even though it is in Java, I believe it will be 
ok to follow it with python (or maybe learn some java, who knows).

Also, I had a very pleasent read of the book "Learn Python the hard way" and ot was quite nice, not only to see an another structure of teaching
those concepts but to also learn a fex extra bits and see some different explanations. 

Will keep this log posted in the future.
