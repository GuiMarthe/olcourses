Ok, so far the course was great, finished it about 2-3 weeks earlier then expected. 
I still am not sure if i'll be going for the advanced track (I thinks that is what is called) with the University of Michigan.
The work with this course and the Data science tool box was realtively simple, yet they served well to get me familiarized again with basics of programmin as well as learning Git and GitHub.
That was quite fun and, I believe, of great value in the future.

Will keep you guys posted.
